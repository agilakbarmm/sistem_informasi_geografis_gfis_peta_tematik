GIS with QGIS for Thematic Mapping
This repository provides a Geographic Information System (GIS) project using QGIS software to create thematic maps. Thematic maps focus on specific themes (such as population density, land use, or resource distribution) and are highly useful in fields like regional planning, environmental research, and spatial analysis.

Key Features
Thematic Map Creation: Step-by-step guidance for creating thematic maps based on specific datasets.
Geospatial Data Analysis: Leverage QGIS tools to manipulate and analyze geospatial data for effective thematic visualization.
Layer Management and Symbology: Apply multiple map layers and adjust symbols (colors, patterns, and styles) to match the map theme.
Open Data Sources: Example data is provided in formats like shapefiles or GeoJSON for practice and learning.
